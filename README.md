# CodeAlpha_Chatot
The main concept behind this chatbot is based on the implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using NLTK library.

Here is the breakdown of the code:

Preprocessing: This section includes text cleaning and preprocessing, which is done using NLTK library. NLTK is used for splitting the raw text into individual words, phrases, sentences, etc. The text is then converted to lowercase for consistency and accuracy.

Greeting: The greeting function is designed to respond to common greetings from the user.

Generating Response: The response function generates a response to the user's query based on the context of the previous conversation. The TfidfVectorizer from the sklearn library is used to calculate the importance of each word in the sentences. Then, cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between the user's query and the sentences in the pre-trained corpus. Finally, the response function fetches the most relevant sentence and returns it as the chatbot's response.

Interactive Chat: The application includes an interactive loop that continues until the user types 'bye'. If the user types a greeting, the chatbot responds accordingly. If the user types 'thanks' or 'thank you', the chatbot responds and ends the conversation. For all other user inputs, the chatbot generates a response based on the pre-trained corpus and returns it to the user.

Overall, this chatbot application is capable of understanding and responding to various user inputs, allowing for more interactive and accurate conversations.
